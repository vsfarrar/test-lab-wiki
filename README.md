# test-lab-wiki
testing GitHub wikis as electronic lab notebook!

Protocols can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/vsfarrar/test-lab-wiki/wiki). Safety documents reside in the lab binder and Google Drive.  _(note to self: would I want to have the protocols in a separate repository, so no one can edit them but me, but can fork them?)_

Organized by assay type workflows. Projects are grouped into Milestones, available under the Issues tab. 

**Active Workflows:**

*[Gel electrophoresis](test_workflow.md)<br>
